Introduction

Although the Sinclair QL comes with a real good BASIC, some commands are missing, which would offer the full power of the
QL. This extension set should increase your motivation to program in BASIC. With over 70 commands and functions, GIGA-BASIC
is a useful extension for the QL. Before starting work with GIGA-BASIC you should read this manual carefully.

You should never work with your original copy of GIGA-BASIC. To obtain working copies a backup program is included. To start
this program enter 'exec_w mdv1_clone'. You can backup GIGA-BASIC up to three times.

The extension includes the following groups
- graphics
- sprite handling and sprite animation
- base conversion
- full screen BASIC editor
- direct access to medium
- multitasking clocks
- mouse driven screen oriented menus
- pull-down-menus
- multitasking control commands
- programmable function keys
- others
